    "-In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "-It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "-The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that \n",
    " no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "-It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "-It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use \n",
    " of objects\n",
    "-Helps in easy maintenance and modification of existing program\n",
